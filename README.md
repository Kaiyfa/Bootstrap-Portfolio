# Bootstrap-Portfolio
##Description
Working With BOOTSTRAP Challenge: Portfolio
I created this project to hone my skills in developing websites that are responsive when viewed on smaller devices in addition to being fully functional.

This project primarily serves as an example showing how effective the bootstrap system can save us a bunch of times  by given us a script to be  used correctly.



##Usage
Here is some screenshot showing the expecting result
